This script finds PRs that were merged in the last X days (defaults to 8)
and reports on doc files that need updating because of those merges.

Use "ai", "ml", or "fabric" as the argument to specify which repo to check. Default is "ml".
Example:
    python merge-report.py 8 ai

    # these are all equivalent:
    python merge-report.py 8 ml
    python merge-report.py 8
    python merge-report.py
